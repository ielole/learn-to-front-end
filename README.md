##About 'three-sixty-five'
  This application was created because there is always something to accomplish. Whether it's
  learning to play the guitar, running a marathon, staying on budget, keeping in contact with
  family and friends, becoming a great dancer or starting a garden, we all make plans to get
  things done. 'Three-sixty-five,' helps users to become or achieve by recording their goals
  and keeping track of progress with daily logs. Users can add picture by entering a image file
  url, (jpg,jpeg,png). What will you achieve in the next three hundred sixty five days?

##Planning and Workflow
  Planning for this application began with a long period of brainstorming about what I
  would like to create. Many ideas were discarded because of scope before settling on
  the idea of a resolution tracker. I drew many wire frames and mapped out data structures.
  I also spent a large amount of time thinking about what the components might be and how
  using Ember.js for the first time, would impact my workflow. Understanding
  where data was going and where actions were coming from was a steady challenge throughtout
  the development process.

  My aim to methodically work through the code that I was writing helped me to catch some of my,
  'data down, action up issues,' but also moving routes around and testing to see if they
  still worked the same way, helped me to understand Ember a bit more. I'm looking forward to
  getting more experience with front end routing in the future.
